# BioLoes

## About this project
This project was set up by me to create my own bio computing library for python.
By doing this, I can just import this library instead of programming the functions that I have already coded.


## Documentation
The complete documentation can be found in the "DOC" folder. This folder contains all 
the functions with their corresponding documentation.
